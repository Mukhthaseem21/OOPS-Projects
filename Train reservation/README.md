# ðŸš† Train Reservation System (OOP Project in Java)

This is a **console-based Java project** that simulates a Train Reservation System using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. 
The system allows users to book and cancel train tickets with features like berth allocation and RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) management.

- Cancel tickets
- Allot berths (Lower, Middle, Upper)
- RAC and Waiting List handling
- Unique Ticket ID generation
- Simple command-line interface

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation** â€“ Proper data hiding with private variables and getters/setters  
- **Inheritance** â€“ Possible extension for admin vs passenger roles  
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Method overriding (if any roles or types are involved)  
- **Abstraction** â€“ Used to hide internal seat-allocation logic  
- **Collections** â€“ `ArrayList`, `Queue`, etc. for storing passengers and tickets
